Verse 1:
Every night before I go to sleep, 
I stop and think about the things I keep
Deep in my heart and soul I know
That nothing quite compares to what I feel when I'm with you

Chorus:
Your love is like a beacon of hope
It lights up my life when I am feeling low
Your arms around me give me comfort and strength
As you let me know there's nothing I can't do

Verse 2:
Whenever I'm feeling down I know
I can call on you and your love will show
Your sweet and kind words fill my head
And so I carry on never fearing what lies ahead

Chorus:
Your love is like a beacon of hope
It lights up my life when I am feeling low
Your arms around me give me comfort and strength
As you let me know there's nothing I can't do

Bridge:
No matter how tough things may seem
With your love I'm sure to follow my dreams
Your kind heart carries me through every storm
Your never-ending love keeps me warm

Chorus:
Your love is like a beacon of hope
It lights up my life when I am feeling low
