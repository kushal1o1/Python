please write me a small poem 
 ------------------------------------



A path I had dreamed of,
Carrying me far from home.
Where life was so different,
And my dreams would never roam.

As I trudged along the way,
Wondering what my fate may be,
The future held many surprises,
That I just couldn't foresee.

But it didn't matter what the future holds,
As long as I kept going strong.
For whatever life I encounter,
It could never go wrong.
