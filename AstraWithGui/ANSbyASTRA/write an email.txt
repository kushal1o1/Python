Dear [Teacher's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I was writing to thank you for all the support you have given me this semester, both inside and outside of the classroom. Your lectures have been insightful and your guidance and encouragement are much appreciated. I have not only been able to develop my skills in the course but my confidence has also grown thanks to your faith in my abilities.

Thank you for being an excellent teacher and a great friend. It's been a pleasure to be in your class this semester.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
