please write a letter to my friend 
 ------------------------------------



Dear [Friend], 

I hope this letter finds you doing well. I've been thinking about you a lot lately and wanted to reach out to you. 

I know you have been going through a tough time lately, but I want you to know that I'm here for you. Whatever you need—whether it's somebody to talk to, a listening ear, or a hug—I'm here. 

Life can be so tough, but I want you to remember that you have a friend who cares about you. Even when things seem hard, you are not alone. We can get through this together.

All my love, 
[Your Name]
