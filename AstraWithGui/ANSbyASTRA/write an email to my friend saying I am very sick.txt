please write an email to my friend saying I am very sick 
 ------------------------------------



Dear Friend,

I hope you're doing well. Unfortunately, I'm not writing to you with good news. I'm very sick and have been fighting off some symptoms for a few days now. It has been a lot more difficult to manage than I expected, and I'm really hoping to start feeling better soon.

I wanted to let you know because I know you've been worried about me and feeling helpless from a distance. I really appreciate the love and support you've been sending my way. It means a lot to me.

Take care, and I'll let you know when I'm feeling better.

All the best,
[Your Name]
